A ruby program to generate basic score/part skeletons for my lilypond
workflow. 

## Feature Implemented

none yet...

## Feature Goals
* Take input from user about
  * Lilypond version (if it can't be found automatically)
  * language
  * files to include
  * names of different instruments
  * number of movements
  * title composer etc?
* output
  * one part per instrument
  * defs file?
  * one score
  * directory structure?
* output files should have
  * version and language statmen
  * include for a defs file and others if needed
  * variables for each part/movement
  * compile (mostly) cleanly (I don't expect to get all edge cases)
